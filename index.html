    <p>Batman is a fictional comic character created by artist Bod Kane and writer Bill Finger. Batman first appeared in
        DC comics in the year 1993 and soon became popular.Originally named the "Bat-Man", the character is also
        referred to by such epithets as the Caped Crusader, the Dark Knight, and the World's Greatest Detective.</p>
    <p>
        Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, an American billionaire, playboy, philanthropist, and owner of Wayne
        Enterprises. After witnessing the murder of his parents Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne as a child, he swore
        revenge on criminals, an oath tempered by a sense of justice. Wayne trains himself physically and intellectually
        and crafts a bat-inspired persona to fight crime. Batman operates in the fictional Gotham City, with assistance
        from various supporting characters, including his butler Alfred, police commissioner Gordon, and vigilante
        allies such as Robin. Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not possess any superpowers; rather, he relies on his
        genius intellect, physical prowess, martial arts abilities, detective skills, science and technology, vast
        wealth, intimidation, and indomitable will. A large assortment of villains make up Batman's rogues gallery,
        including his archenemy, the Joker.</p>

        <h2>Secret Identity:Bruce Wayne</h2>
        <img id="image" src="./img/wayne.PNG" alt="Bruce Wayne">
        <p>Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American industrialist who resides just outside of Gotham
            City. As a child, Bruce witnessed the murder of his parents, Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, which ultimately
            led him to craft the Batman persona and seek vengeance against criminals. Wayne averts suspicion by acting
            the part of a superficial playboy idly living off his family's fortune, which was amassed through investment
            in real estate before the city became a bustling metropolis, and the profits of Wayne Enterprises, his
            inherited conglomerate.Bruce Wayne resides just outside of Gotham City in Wayne Manor. He supports
            philanthropic causes through his nonprofit Wayne Foundation, but is more widely known as a celebrity
            socialite. In public, he appears frequently in the company of high-status women, which encourages tabloid
            gossip. Although Bruce Wayne leads an active romantic life, crime-fighting accounts for most of his time
